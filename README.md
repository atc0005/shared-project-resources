Shared workflows and tooling for projects that I maintain

## Overview

In general, this repo is intended to help deduplicate efforts spent
maintaining CI resources across multiple projects.

At present this includes "base" or "include" GitHub Actions workflow files. In
the future this may also include common linting, build or test configurations.
